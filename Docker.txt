difficult to emulate environment(mangodb,oracle,tomcat,asp.net..)
works on my machine..not in yours

images : tomcat, helloworld.. on dockerhub
How to pull image
Ex : docker pull node

The role of images and containers
Docker image : Ubuntu with node.js and application code
Docker image -----------> Dcoker container
created by using an image. runs your application.

containers are the instance of image 

docker ps
docker ps -a
docker compose -up => to run all containers?
docker-compose up -d
docker-cmpose build => info about maintainer,environment..

What is Docker?
Benefits
Tools

What is Docker?
lightweight, open, secure platform
simplify building, shipping, running apps
Shipping container system for code
Runs natively on Linux or Windows Server
Runs on Windows or Mac Development machines(with a virtual machine)

Relies on "images" and "containers"

The Role of Images and Containers
---------------------------------
Docker image: 
example: Ubuntu with Node.js and Application Code

Docker Container
Created by using an image. Runs your application.

Image
A read-only template composed of layered filesystems used to share common
files and create Docker container instances.

Container
An isolated and secured shipping container created from an image that can be
run, started, stopped, moved and deleted.



Where Does Docker Run?
on linux or windows server

Docker containers vs Virtual machines
-------------------------------------
virtual machines always run on top of the o.s.


can have multiple containers
container for database
container for cache
container for application code


Benefits
--------
set up development environment very quickly
eliminate app confilicts
environment consistency e.g. development and production
Ship Software faster

set up development environment very quickly
we may have web server, caching server, database server

different version running on different container
Docker is NOT the same as using Virtual Machines
Docker Tools:
Docker toolbox, Docker machine, Docker Compose, Docker Kitematic, VirtualBox

https://www.docker.com/docker-toolbox
provides image and container tools
Virtual machine(for windowns/Mac)
Works on Windows, Mac, Linux


Docker in Action
----------------

Dockerhub - cloud based repository

Docker Machine commands :
-------------------------
docker-machine ls
docker-machine start[machine name]
docker-machine stop[machine name]
docker-machine env[machine name]
docker-machine ip[machine name]

docker-machine ls
docker-machine ip default
docker-machine status default
>Running

Key Docker Client Commands:
docker pull[image name]

docker run[image name]

To list all images
docker images


docker ps => process

docker => to view all commands

rm - remove one or more containers
rmi - remove one or more images
export - export a container's filesystem as a tar archive
pull - pull an image or a repository from a registry
push - push an image or a repository to a registry
run - run a command in a new container

https://hub.docker.com
find out "hello-world" image


docker pull hello-world


docker images => you will see hello-world

docker run hello-world
docker ps =>running containers

docker ps -a => to view all containers in a system


To remove container:e.g.24f77ed8e465
>docker rm 24

to remove images:e.g.0a6ba7834
docker rmi [image id]
>docker rmi 0a


Docker machine creates and manages machines
Docker client manages images and containers
