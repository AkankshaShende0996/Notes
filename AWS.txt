AWS
Officially launched in 2006
Largest cloud provider

core services
-Elastic Cloud Compute(EC2)
-Simple Storage Service(S3)
Relational Database Service(RDS)
Route53


Ehancing Your App with AWS Databases and Application Services(extended service)
Elastic BeanStalk(EB)
DynamoDB & RedShift
Virtual Private Cloud(VPC)
CoundFront
CloudWatch


different ways to access AWS - browser,commandline,application code

can run any type of application
-------------------------------------------------------------------

AWS is a provider of Cloud Services

NETFLIX- entire infrastructure running on AWS


Why Depend on AWS?
Low cost
Easy Scalability

server for serving web application
server for database
broadband
dedicated room to keep all the hardwares for safety

with AWS, there are no upfront costs

with AWS you only pay what you uses

AWS also provides handy calculator for the estimating cost


Scalability
successfully launched web app, no. of hits increased.
web app dies as too many request
what is option - to buy another server. which may take days,weeks..in the meantime users are suffering and ultimately killing the business.

with aws takes few seconds only to add server


Tracing the Global Infrastructure of AWS
ability to deploy the app in different gloabl location
Why Deploy Globally?
Reduced Latency
Increased Redundancy

Get the webapplication closer(Germany,USA,Singapore..) to the user

Scaling across Regions and AZ's(Availability Zones) increases redundancy

How AWS works
-------------
There is not a single protocol all the services use.
Usually you r taking initiative to interact diff services.
VPC and make local ipaddress

AWS vs rest
-----------
Microsoft Azure
-Coud services provider started around 2010

Azure may be the advantage if you want to use IIS and windows virtual machines
If you are working with .NET applications
If you want the latest and greatest from Microsoft


Microsoft Azure does not support following things
If you need global reach
If it lacks services from AWS that you need
If you want the latest and greatest from Amazon(e.g. Lamda and Gateway)

IBM Bluemix
-----------
Cloud services provider started around 2014

implements the CLOUDFOUNDRY open source infrastructure specification

IBM Bluemix supports
--------------------
If you want to be provider independent
If you want your training and skills to be portable
 
IBM Bluemix does not support
----------------------------
If you don't need portability
If you want services not covered by CloudFoundry
If you need protability and want the latest from IBM

Heroku
------
Cloud services provider started around 2007

Heroku app deployment is dead simple...but 
it lacks the breadth and reach of AWS


AWS

Price+Scalability+Location



Elastic Cloud Compute(EC2) - The solution for your computing needs
launched in 2006
virtual machine

What can you do with EC2?
------------------------
Run Applications
Virtual Desktop
3rd Party Software
Computing

Elastic Cloud Compute
Cloud Compute - Computing services operating in remote data servers around the world
Elastic - Instances running computing operations can increase or decrease at will

EC2 instance

Amazon Machine Image(AMI)
operating system + Software used on an EC2 Instance

Amazon updates the image software...
...not your instance

EC2 Instances :
Number of instances - 1 or 
Auto scaling Group - Rules for automatically scaling EC2 images up and down

Use EC2 for scaling AMIs
Use EB for scaling applications


Elastic Block Storage(EBS)


Use EBS for EC2 file systems
Use S3 for file storage

Security Group - IP based communication rules for a single or group of service instances

Example Security Group Scenarios
Control who can SSH into EC2 instance
Allow access between EC2 instances
Allow access to database
Accept http requests

EC2 instances are charged by the hour
Prices change based on: Instance Type , AMI Type

EC2 Pricing Example
Instance Type   AMI              Rate per hour
r3.large       Amazon Linux      $0.166USD
Daily Rate:$3.98USD

t2.micro =>daily rate $0.31USD


EC2 Instance Pricing Types
On-Demand instances - cheap
Reserved Instances - cheaper
Spot Instances - Cheapest

Simple Storage Service(S3)
---------------------------
The solution for your storage needs
Maximum file size is 5 terabytes!

bucket - where you add, modify, delete objects

S3 Buckets can :
-trigger events when objects are added/modified/deleted
-preserve older versions of objects
-replicate objects across regions

S3 Buckets are accessed via URL

S3 Bucket URL Example:
https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/okfido.org/img/okfido.png
region,bucket name and object path

How to solve Latency in S3
step 1:Use CloudFront
step 2:Relax

S3 Pricing Structure:
Amount of Data Stored
Number of Requests
Amount of Data Transferred


Prices differ per region

ex. Oregon region
Amount of Data Stored - $0.03 USD per GB
Number of Requests - $0.005 USD per 1000 requests
Amount of Data Transferred - $0.09 USD per GB


Relational Database Service
---------------------------
Managed Database Aspects.
Managed because Amazon web service takes care of
-scheduled automated backups
-simple software updates
-managed infrastructure

Database of EC2 vs RDS
EC2
Database backups
redundancy
software patches

RDS
AWS handles it all +
easy configuration, read replicas

RDS Database options
mysql,PostgreSQL, SQLServer,MariaDB,Oracle,Amazon Aurora


You can install a database with EC2 on your own... but
having Amazon manage the database for you will save you headaches.

RDS makes it easy to :
take db snapshots
change the hardware

AWS takes security seriously.

RDS Pricing structure:
type of database
region
ec2 instance type
ex.mysql database
$o.35 USD perhour
$8.40 USD per day

Other Managed Database Offerings from Amazon
DynamoDB(NoSQL Database)
RedShift(Data Warehouse)

Route53
-------
The solution for your DNS needs
Domain Name System
System that translates human-readable URLs to IP addresses.
Route53 is core to letting users interact with services in AWS.
