About SVN
---------
-Merge based
 Developers check out local copies of code
 Changes to the same file are 'merged'
-Commits are atomic
-Uses properties for metadata
-Branching and tagging are copies
-Different implementations

Basic Architecture
------------------
	Working Copy

	SVN Client

	Services(Apache/SVN server)

	Repository

	File System



SVN Client can communicate with Repository apart from Services


Repository Structure
--------------------
Repositories
   scratch
     branches
     tags
     trunk

Branches
--------
-Branched code goes here
-Uses copy to be efficient

-Can branch any part of code
-Branches are like new trees

	
  
Tags
-Just a name for a revision
-Also  is a copy, but read only
 Doesn't take up additional space
